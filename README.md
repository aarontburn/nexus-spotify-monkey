# [Nexus](https://github.com/aarontburn/nexus-core): Spotify Monkey





<img src="./src/assets/spotify-monkey.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

A module for [Nexus](https://github.com/aarontburn/nexus-core) to "embed" Spotify as a Nexus module...

And by "embed", this just takes the Spotify window and monkeys it around.


## Limitations:
- Requires Spotify to be installed.
- Requires the `Spotify.exe` location to be somewhere accessible to the current user.
  - This module will not work with Spotify downloaded from the Microsoft Store for this reason.
